=== Access your Chainlink node
You can access your Chainlink node through the web graphical user interface. There are two options on accessing the page.

1. Access the Chainlink node web GUI through the application load balancer endpoint or through a domain by adding the load balancer endpoint to your domain's DNS record.

2. By enabling TCP port forwarding on your bastion host, you are able to port forward the Chainlink node web GUI to your machine. As we are accessing the Chainlink node through a bastion, it is recommended to use SSH agent forwarding. Then connect to your bastion with SSH agent and TCP port forwarding. You can access the Chainlink node web GUI at http://localhost:6688/. 

....
ssh-add <your_ssh_key>
ssh ec2-user@<bastion_host_public_ip> -A -L 6688:localhost:6688
ssh ec2-user@<chainlink_node_internal_ip> -L 6688:localhost:6688
....

=== Manually creating your .env and .password files for Chainlink node Docker instance
If the Chainlink node docker instances are stopped, then you will need to manually generate the .env and .password files to be able to start the Chainlink nodes.

Blockchain Network (chainNetwork):

- ETH-Mainnet
- Kovan-ETH-Testnet
- Rinkeby-ETH-Testnet
- xDai-Mainnet
- Heco-Mainnet
- BSC-Mainnet
- Matic-Mainnet

Generating the .env file:
....
cd /home/ec2-user/.chainlink/ && ./create-env.sh \
${chainNetwork} \
${blockchainNodeUrl} \
${psqlUser} \
$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id DBSecret --query "SecretString" --output text) \
${psqlHostname} \
${psqlPort} \
${psqlDb}
....

Generating the .password file:
....
cd /home/ec2-user/.chainlink/ && ./create-password.sh \
$(aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id WalletSecret --query "SecretString" --output text)
....

=== Docker run command to start Chainlink node instances
To manually run the latest image of Chainlink node Docker instance:

....
latestimage=$(curl -s -S "https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/smartcontract/chainlink/tags/" | jq -r '."results"[]["name"]' | head -n 1)
cd /home/ec2-user/.chainlink && docker run -d \
--log-driver=awslogs \
--log-opt awslogs-group=ChainlinkLogs \
--restart unless-stopped \
--name chainlink \
-p 6688:6688 \
-v /home/ec2-user/.chainlink:/chainlink \
--env-file=/home/ec2-user/.chainlink/.env  smartcontract/chainlink:$latestimage local n \
-p /chainlink/.password
....

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

=== Restricting Access
To run a Chainlink node, the Operator UI port does not need to be open on the internet for it to correctly function. Due to this, we recommend restricting access to all of the services required over the internet.

=== Failover Capabilities
To ensure there is very minimal downtime, failover capabilities are required on both the Chainlink and Ethereum clients so that if any one server fails, the service is still online. The Auto Scaling Group has two Chainlink nodes: one active Chainlink node and one standby Chainlink node.

=== Disaster Recovery
Problems occur and when they do, the right processes need to be in-place to ensure that as little downtime as possible occurs. The main impediment to incurring large amounts of downtime in the context of Chainlink node operators is a fully corrupted Ethereum node that requires a re-sync.

Due to the challenge of recovering an Ethereum client, we recommend:

- Daily snapshots of the Ethereum chain on a separate server than what the Chainlink node is connected to.
- An Ethereum client start-up process that pulls down the latest template of the chain and syncs it to the latest height.

With this process in-place, the elapsed time of full disaster is kept to a minimum.

=== Active Monitoring

To be proactive in detecting any issues before or when they occur, active monitoring needs to be in place. The areas where we recommend to monitor are:

- (Minimum Required) ETH balance of the wallet address assigned to the node.
- Errored job runs.
- Operator UI port to be open and responsive. (Usually: 6688)
- Ethereum http and websocket ports to be open and responsive. (Usually: 8545 & 8546)
- Ethereum client disk, RAM and CPU usage.

Monitoring of the Chainlink nodes are available through Amazon CloudWatch.

== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

The Chainlink node Docker instance requires both an .env and .password file that contain plaintext passwords. It is recommended to remove these files once the Chainlink node instance is running.

//== Other useful information
//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.

//_Add any other details that will help the customer use the software on AWS._
